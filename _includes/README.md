## How to add new stuff to sidebar

First make sure your .md file has the following at the start. It should be like about.md in the main folder.

```
---
layout: page
title: (title change here only)
---
```

Then go into sidebar.html. You should see a comment (gray looking text)
Do whatever it's saying
