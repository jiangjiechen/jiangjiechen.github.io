Jiangjie Chen (ÈôàÊ±üÊç∑) is a third-year Ph.D. candidate at Fudan University (FDU) in School of Computer Science and Technology, Shanghai, China, where he is advised by [Prof. Yanghua Xiao](http://kw.fudan.edu.cn). He is also currently a research intern at ByteDance AI Lab, where he work closely with [Prof. Lei Li](https://lileicc.github.io) (now at UCSB), [Dr. Hao Zhou](https://zhouh.github.io) and [Dr. Changzhi Sun](https://www.czsun.site). 


He is a zealous believer in <b><i>reasoning over natural language</i></b> and dedicated to make neural models <b><i>right for the right reasons</i></b>.

His research interests mainly lie in <b><i>Explainable Natural Language Processing (ExNLP)</i></b>, <b><i>Natural Language Generation (NLG)</i></b> and <b><i>Common-sense Reasoning (CSR)</i></b>, and particularly the deep integration of them. My previous research interests also include <b><i>Knowledge Graph Construction (KGC)</i></b>.
