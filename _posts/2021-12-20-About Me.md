title: About Me
---

I am a third-year Ph.D. candidate at Fudan University (FDU) in School of Computer Science and Technology, Shanghai, China, where I am advised by [Prof. Yanghua Xiao](http://kw.fudan.edu.cn). I am also currently a research intern at ByteDance AI Lab, where I work closely with [Prof. Lei Li](https://lileicc.github.io) (now at UCSB), [Dr. Hao Zhou](https://zhouh.github.io) and [Dr. Changzhi Sun](https://www.czsun.site). 

## Research Interests

I am a zealous believer in <b><i>reasoning over natural language</i></b> and dedicated to make neural models <b><i>right for the right reasons</i></b>.

My research interests mainly lie in <b><i>Explainable Natural Language Processing (ExNLP)</i></b>, <b><i>Natural Language Generation (NLG)</i></b> and <b><i>Common-sense Reasoning (CSR)</i></b>, and particularly the deep integration of them. My previous research interests also include <i>Knowledge Graph Construction (KGC)</i>.
