title: About Me
---

I am a third-year Ph.D. candidate at Fudan University (FDU) in School of Computer Science and Technology, Shanghai, China, where I am advised by [Prof. Yanghua Xiao](http://kw.fudan.edu.cn). I am also currently a research intern at ByteDance AI Lab, where I work closely with [Prof. Lei Li](https://lileicc.github.io) (now at UCSB), [Dr. Hao Zhou](https://zhouh.github.io) and [Dr. Changzhi Sun](https://www.czsun.site). 

## Research Interests

I am dedicated to make neural models ***right for the right reasons***. I am also a zealous believer in ***reasoning over natural language*** and committed to this topic.

My research interests mainly lie in ***Explainable Natural Language Processing (ExNLP)***, ***Natural Language Generation (NLG)*** and ***Common-sense Reasoning (CSR)***, and particularly the deep integration of them. My previous research interests also include *knowledge graph construction*.
