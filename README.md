# Welcome to Remy
https://remyie.github.io/remy/ <br>
Remy is a Hyde flavor which aims to be more user friendly.<br>
Hyde is a brazen two-column Jekyll theme that pairs a prominent sidebar with uncomplicated content. It's based on Poole, the Jekyll butler.<br>
None of the code is actually mine. Here where it comes from https://github.com/poole/hyde <br>
It's under MIT license. <br>
I only did some changes and made it easier to setup.

## Can I use it?
Yeah sure, go for it. I made a simple site template just for you.

1. Create a Github account, create a new repository and name it yourusername.github.io, go in to your repository>settings>pages, enable Github Pages using /(root).
2. Download the site template from here and unzip it. Upload the stuff inside it to your repository by simply dragging. It should look like mine.
3. Open config.yml and change title and baseurl. Base url needs to be your Github repository name. It should look like this ```https://username.github.io/```

You are done. You should be able to visit your site by going into yourusername.github.io
