Directly displaying recalled articles by a search engine lacks a deep understanding of the article contents. Generating clickable queries, on the other hand, summarizes an article in various aspects, which can be henceforth utilized to better connect relevant articles. Most existing approaches for generating article queries, however, do not consider the diversity of queries or whether they are appealing enough, which are essential for boosting user experience and platform drainage. To this end, we propose a Knowledge-Enhanced Diversified QuerY Generator (KeDy), which leverages an external knowledge graph (KG) as guidance. We diversify the query generation with the information of semantic neighbors of the entities in articles. We further constrain the diversification process with entity popularity knowledge to build appealing queries that users may be more interested in. The information within KG is propagated towards more popular entities with popularity-guided graph attention. We collect a news-query dataset from the search logs of a real-world search engine. Extensive experiments demonstrate our proposed KeDy can generate more diversified and insightful related queries than several strong baselines.","tags":["Knowledge Graph","Text Generation","Diversified Generation"],"title":"Diversified Query Generation Guided with Knowledge Graph","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Qiaoben Bao","Jiangjie Chen","Linfang Liu","Jiaqing Liang","Jingping Liu","Yanghua Xiao"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1645401600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1645401600,"objectID":"1541906bfaf97f0234d89ffc98140ae9","permalink":"https://jiangjiechen.github.io/publication/scope/","publishdate":"2022-01-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/scope/","section":"publication","summary":"Automatic Answer span Extraction (AE) focuses on identifying key information from paragraphs that can be asked. It has been used to facilitate downstream question generation tasks or data augmentation for question answering. Current work of AE heavily relies on the annotated answer spans from Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC) datasets. However, these methods suffer from the partial annotation problem due to the annotation protocols of MRC tasks. To tackle this problem, we propose SCOPE, a Structured Context graph network with Positive-unlabeled learning. SCOPE first represents the paragraph by constructing a graph with both syntactic and semantic edges, then adopts a unified pointer network for answer span identification. SCOPE narrows the discrenpency between AE and MRC by formulating AE as a Positive-unlabeled (PU) learning problem, thus recovering more answer spans from paragraphs. To evaluate newly extracted spans without annotation, we also present an automatic metric from the perspective of question answering and text summarization, which correlates well with human judgments. Comprehensive experiments on both AE and downstream tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.","tags":["Information Extraction"],"title":"Harvesting More Answer Spans from Paragraphs beyond Annotation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xinyao Shen","Jiangjie Chen","Yanghua Xiao"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1634256000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1634256000,"objectID":"634c990bea69abfc3318cef06290dc18","permalink":"https://jiangjiechen.github.io/publication/keep/","publishdate":"2021-07-31T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/keep/","section":"publication","summary":"Paraphrases refer to text with different expressions conveying the same meaning, which is usually modeled as a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) learning problem. Traditional Seq2Seq models mainly concentrate on fidelity while ignoring the diversity of paraphrases. Although recent studies begin to focus on the diversity of generated paraphrases, they either adopt inflexible control mechanisms or restrict to synonyms and topic knowledge. In this paper, we propose KnowledgE-Enhanced Paraphraser (KEEP) for diversified paraphrase generation, which leverages a commonsense knowledge graph to explicitly enrich the expressions of paraphrases. Specifically, KEEP retrieves word-level and phrase-level knowledge from an external knowledge graph, and learns to choose more related ones using graph attention mechanism.
